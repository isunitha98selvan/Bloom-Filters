# Bloom-Filters

Bloom filters are a probablistic data structure which are used to determine with certainity whether an element is not present in a set or determine with a certain probablility if the element is present in the set.

## Python Implementation of Accurate Counting Bloom Filters
We use ACBF to reduce the false positive probability. We split a bit array into multiple levels to improve the accuracy.We implement ACBFs to calculate if the username already exists and if the password is weak.


## Python Implementation of Scalable Bloom filters
Dynamic implementation of a bloom filter. The bitarray size increases according to the number of elements to be added.
