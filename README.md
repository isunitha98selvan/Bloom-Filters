# Bloom-Filters

Bloom filters are a probablistic data structure which are used to determine with certainity whether an element is not present in a set or determine with a certain probablility if the element is present in the set.

##Python Implementation of Accurate Counting Bloom Filters
We use ACBF to reduce the false positive probability.We implement ACBFs to calculate if the username already exists and if the password is weak.


Work to be done:
Find out how to calculate the false probabilty
Implement attenuated bloom filters.
